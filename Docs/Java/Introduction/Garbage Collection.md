# Garbage collection
Garbage collection is like tidying up your room: 

it's a process in a computer's memory management that automatically finds and gets rid of the stuff (unused or unneeded data) to free up space. 

Just as you might throw away things you no longer need to keep your room clean, garbage collection helps the computer reclaim memory that's no longer being used by the program, making the system run more efficiently.
