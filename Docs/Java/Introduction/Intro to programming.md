# Introduction to programming
## What is programming language
A programming language is a structured method of communicating with computers, using syntax and rules to create software and automate tasks effectively.
## Types of Languages
### 1. Procedural Languages
A procedural language is a type of programming language where instructions are written in a step-by-step manner, following a sequence or procedure to perform tasks or operations.
### 2. Functional Language
Functional languages are programming styles focusing on using functions as the primary building blocks, emphasizing immutability and treating computations as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

### 3. Object Oriented Language
An object-oriented language is a way of writing computer code that organizes data and actions together in "objects," making it easier to manage and reuse code for different tasks.
