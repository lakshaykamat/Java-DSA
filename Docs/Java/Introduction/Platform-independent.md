# Platform Independence in Java
- Bytecode, generated from Java source code, is designed to be executable on any operating system.
- Source code needs to be converted into machine code for the computer to understand and execute it.
- The compiler translates the source code into executable code, which comprises a set of instructions for the computer's processor.
- In languages like C/C++, compiling code generates platform-specific executables (e.g., `.exe` files), making them platform-dependent.
- Contrastingly, Java compiles source code into bytecode, which is platform-independent.
- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) plays a crucial role by interpreting bytecode and converting it into machine code specific to the underlying operating system and hardware.
- While Java itself is platform-independent due to its bytecode, the JVM implementation is platform-dependent, as different operating systems require their specific JVM versions for proper execution.
