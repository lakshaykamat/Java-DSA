# Static Languages
A static language is a type of programming language where the types of variables are determined at compile-time and remain fixed during the program's execution. 

In static languages, type checking occurs before the code runs, during the compilation phase.

## Errors in static languages
### Syntax Errors
These occur due to incorrect syntax in the code and are usually caught during compilation. 

For example, missing semicolons, incorrect variable declarations, or invalid function calls.
### Type Errors
These occur when there's an attempt to assign an incompatible type to a variable, use an incorrect type for an operation, or pass the wrong type of argument to a function. 

These errors are detected during compilation as the types are checked beforehand.
