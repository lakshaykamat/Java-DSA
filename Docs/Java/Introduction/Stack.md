# Stack
Think of a stack like a pile of books. 
When you add a new book, you put it on top, and when you want to take a book, you grab the top one. 

Similarly, in computing, a stack is a data structure that stores information in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner. 

When a program runs, the stack keeps track of function calls, local variables, and their order of execution, making sure that the last thing added (the most recent function called or variable declared) is the first thing removed.
