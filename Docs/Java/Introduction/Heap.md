# Heap
Imagine a big storage area where you can put things randomly and pick them up whenever you need. 

In computing, the heap is like that storage spaceâ€”it's a place where the computer can dynamically store data during a program's execution. 

It's less structured than the stack and allows for flexible storage and retrieval of information as needed. 

Programs use the heap for tasks like allocating memory for objects, structures, or variables whose size can change during runtime.
