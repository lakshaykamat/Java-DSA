# Dynamic Languages
In a dynamic language, types are determined during runtime, allowing more flexibility in coding as variables can change their type. 


Errors in dynamic languages are often related to the unexpected behavior of the code during execution:

## 1.Runtime Errors: 
These errors occur when the program is running and are not caught during the initial coding or compilation phase. 

They can include issues like division by zero, using variables before they're defined, or attempting operations on incompatible data types.

## 2. Type Errors
Because types are determined during runtime, errors can occur when performing operations on data that don't match the expected types. 

For instance, trying to perform arithmetic operations on a string or treating a number as a function.
