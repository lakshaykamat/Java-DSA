# Bytecode
_Bytecode refers to the intermediate code generated by the Java compiler from the source code._ 

When you write Java code, the `.java` files are compiled by the Java compiler (`javac`) into bytecode, which is stored in `.class` files.

- Bytecode is a **set of instructions** understood by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
- It is [[Platform-independent]], which means that once the Java source code is compiled into bytecode, it can be executed on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine installed. 
>"write once, run anywhere" principle.

The bytecode instructions are **not machine code** for any specific computer architecture but are designed to be efficiently interpreted by the JVM. 

During execution, the JVM reads the bytecode and translates it into machine code suitable for the underlying hardware.

## Why Bytecode
- Bytecode provides a level of abstraction between the Java code and the underlying hardware, allowing Java programs to be portable across different platforms without requiring recompilation.
- This architecture enables the Java language to be highly versatile and widely used in various applications and environments.
