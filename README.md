# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Java
Leet Code Profile: https://leetcode.com/lakshaykamat/


Welcome to my repository dedicated to Data Structures and Algorithms practice using Java. Here, you'll find solutions to various LeetCode questions and comprehensive documentation for understanding DSA concepts.

## LeetCode Solutions

I've solved several LeetCode problems using Java and have provided solutions in this repository. Each solution includes code written in Java along with explanations where necessary.

### Example LeetCode Problems:

1. [Two Sum](./LeetCode/TwoSum.java)
2. [Reverse Linked List](./LeetCode/ReverseLinkedList.java)
3. [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](./LeetCode/BinaryTreeInorderTraversal.java)
   <!-- Add more examples as needed -->

Feel free to explore the [LeetCode](./LeetCode/) directory for more solutions.

## DSA Documentation

In addition to solving problems, I've created comprehensive documentation to guide beginners through various DSA concepts. The documentation covers topics such as:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- ...and more!

You can access the DSA guide documentation [here](./DSA_Guide/Documentation.md).

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions, found a bug in the code, or want to add more solutions, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
